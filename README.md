    <p>
        After logging in with your Google account, players can be added to the game. The number of 
        players determines the number of score rows generated in the card, and each row assigns itself 
        to a player for whom to credit each score put down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Totals, including in and out scores, are automatically calculated upon edit of any score in the card. 
        To edit scores, simply click a scorebox and edit.
